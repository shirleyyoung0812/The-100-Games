The-100-Games
=============
Implement 100 Game

In "the 100 game," two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1..10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins. What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers? For example, if two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers of 1..15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100. This problem is to write a program that determines which player would win with ideal play.

Write a procedure, "Boolean canIWin(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal)", which returns true if the first player to move can force a win with optimal play.

Your priority should be programmer efficiency; don't focus on minimizing either space or time complexity.
